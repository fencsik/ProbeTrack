* data01: generates table of accuracy and RT statistics separated by
  subjects, gap duration, number of targets, probe type, and probe
  delay

- an0101: anova on RT as a function of probe delay and probe type
- an0102: anova on accuracy as a function of probe delay and probe type
- an0103: t-tests comparing RT on gap trials at each probe delay to RT
  on no-gap trials
- an0104: t-tests comparing accuracy on gap trials at each probe delay
  to accuracy on no-gap trials

* fig0101: plot correct RT by probe delay separated by gap duration
  and probe type
- fig0102: plot accuracy by probe delay separated by gap duration and
  probe type
* fig0103: plot correct RT by probe delay separated by gap duration
- fig0104: plot accuracy by probe delay separated by number of targets
