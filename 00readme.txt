Code:

* Search: speedsearch, winsearch, and acceleration search
* SpeedTrack: speedtrack
* colortrack:
* noahtrack:
* repulse: flashtrack


Experiments:

* driftsearch01: next twist on speed search studies, where subjects
  search among moving gratings; compared fast/slow asymmetry for
  oscillating vs. unidirectional gratings
* driftsearch02: control study with oscillating motion replaced with
  each stimulus moving in a random direction (balanced across stimuli)
* driftsearch03: control study, in which grouping is broken up by
  using heterogeneous distractor speeds (aborted after 4 subjects and
  replaced by driftsearch04)
* driftsearch04: same as driftsearch03, but with a different set of
  comparison conditions

* flashtrack1: first FlashTrack study with either one target or one
  distractor flashing

* getmoving01: follow-up on stoptrack studies; how much pre-gap motion
  information is enough to encode direction of motion?
* getmoving02: replication of getmoving01 with more pre-gap durations;
  stopped early because only 4 targets were used, which made analysis
  difficult
* getmoving03: replication of getmoving01 with more pre-gap durations

* probetrack1: basic probetrack experiment--track 4 out of 8 with SOAs
  of 0, 80, 160, 320, and 1280 ms--with a 133 ms gap
* probetrack2: added more SOAs to probetrack1--0, 40, 80, 120, 160,
  and 1280 ms
* probetrack3: added multiple gap durations--133, 307, and 507 ms--and
  more SOAs--0, 40, 80, 120, 160, 320, 960, and 1280 ms--to
  probetrack1
* probetrack4: probetrack1 with 307 ms gaps, SOAs of 0, 80, 320, and
  1280 ms, tracking 1, 2, 3, or 4 targets out of 8 disks
* probetrack5: control for probetrack4 without gaps to estimate
  baseline performance at each level of tracking load

* shifttrack2: compare tracking performance across no-disappearance,
  shift 0, and shift 1 conditions, with movement speeds of 6 and 10
  degrees/second with 5 targets
* shifttrack3: compare tracking performance at shift -1, 0, and 1,
  with 5 targets and moving after reappearance
* shifttrack4: compare tracking performance at shift -1, 0, and 1,
  with 2 vs. 5 targets, and static reappearance
* shifttrack5: shifttrack3 with asynchronous disappearance
* shifttrack6: shifttrack4 with a within-block design
* shifttrack7: odd-one-out design
* shifttrack8: shifttrack6 with 1 vs. 4 targets
* shifttrack9: within-subject comparison of synch vs. asynch

* stoptrack1: compare performance on moving and static trials with 1
  or 4 targets
* stoptrack2: stoptrack1 with 1, 2, 3, or 4 targets
* stoptrack3: stoptrack1 with random trial durations and 2 or 4
  targets
* stoptrack4: replicates stoptrack3 with a new set of naive subjects
* stoptrack5 (NIA): stoptrack4 (?) with a fixation point, and
  instructions to either fixate it or move eyes freely (incomplete)
* stoptrack6: stoptrack with probe-one response instead of click-all,
  within-block manipulation of preview type and load, and loads of 2,
  3, and 4 targets

* switchtrack1: one distractor reappears post-gap in a location that a
  target had occupied prior to the gap

* speedtrack01 (NIA): pilot speed-tracking study, with 4/8 targets;
  incomplete
* speedtrack02: first actual speed-tracking tracking study (paired
  with speedsearch04)
* speedtrack03 (NIA): attempt at speed-tracking study with different
  speeds (6.4 and 9.6, instead of 3.2 and 6.4), but tracking portion
  was aborted with 3 subjects and only the search portion was run, but
  with a limited exposure duration (paired with SpeedSearch07, but not
  the speedsearch07 in the repository)
* speedtrack04 (NIA): manipulated tracking interval duration to look
  for interaction between dur and target-speed

* speedsearch01: first conveyor belt study
* speedsearch02: conveyor belt study with background grid
* speedsearch03: conveyor belt study with vertical noise
* speedsearch04: first study with MOT-like motion (paired with
  speedtrack02)
* speedsearch05 (NIA): aborted MOT-like search with limited exposure
  duration
* speedsearch06: MOT-like search with staircased exposure durations
* speedsearch07: conveyor belt study with fixed distractor speed (not
  quite complete)
* speedsearch08: conveyor belt study with fixed distractor speed and
  within-block design
* speedsearch09: conveyor belt study with fixed distractor speed and
  a target speed intermediate between distractor and fast target
* speedsearch10: conveyor belt study with small differences between
  speeds to see if that leads to a slope effect

* winsearch01: speed-search with windows
* winsearch02: winsearch01 with drop-shadows for depth
* winsearch03: winsearch02 with fixed distractor speed and multiple
  target speeds

NIA = not in archive
