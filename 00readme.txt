$LastChangedDate$

* flashtrack1: first FlashTrack study with either one target or one
  distractor flashing

* shifttrack2: compare tracking performance across no-disappearance,
  shift 0, and shift 1 conditions, with movement speeds of 6 and 10
  degrees/second with 5 targets
* shifttrack3: compare tracking performance at shift -1, 0, and 1,
  with 5 targets and moving after reappearance
* shifttrack4: compare tracking performance at shift -1, 0, and 1,
  with 2 vs. 5 targets, and static reappearance
* shifttrack5: shifttrack3 with asynchronous disappearance
* shifttrack6: shifttrack4 with a within-block design
* shifttrack7: odd-one-out design
* shifttrack8: shifttrack6 with 1 vs. 4 targets

* stoptrack1: compare performance on moving and static trials with 1
  or 4 targets
* stoptrack2: stoptrack1 with 1, 2, 3, or 4 targets
* stoptrack3: stoptrack1 with random trial durations and 2 or 4
  targets
* stoptrack4: replicates stoptrack3 with a new set of naive subjects
