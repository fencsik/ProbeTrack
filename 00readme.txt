Code:

* Search: speedsearch
* SpeedTrack: speedtrack
* colortrack:
* noahtrack:
* repulse: flashtrack


Experiments:

* flashtrack1: first FlashTrack study with either one target or one
  distractor flashing

* shifttrack2: compare tracking performance across no-disappearance,
  shift 0, and shift 1 conditions, with movement speeds of 6 and 10
  degrees/second with 5 targets
* shifttrack3: compare tracking performance at shift -1, 0, and 1,
  with 5 targets and moving after reappearance
* shifttrack4: compare tracking performance at shift -1, 0, and 1,
  with 2 vs. 5 targets, and static reappearance
* shifttrack5: shifttrack3 with asynchronous disappearance
* shifttrack6: shifttrack4 with a within-block design
* shifttrack7: odd-one-out design
* shifttrack8: shifttrack6 with 1 vs. 4 targets
* shifttrack9: within-subject comparison of synch vs. asynch

* stoptrack1: compare performance on moving and static trials with 1
  or 4 targets
* stoptrack2: stoptrack1 with 1, 2, 3, or 4 targets
* stoptrack3: stoptrack1 with random trial durations and 2 or 4
  targets
* stoptrack4: replicates stoptrack3 with a new set of naive subjects

* switchtrack1: one distractor reappears post-gap in a location that a
  target had occupied prior to the gap

* speedtrack01 (NIA): pilot speed-tracking study, with 4/8 targets;
  incomplete
* speedtrack02: first actual speed-tracking tracking study (paired
  with speedsearch04)

* speedsearch01: first conveyor belt study
* speedsearch02 (NIA): conveyor belt study with background grid
* speedsearch03 (NIA): conveyor belt study with vertical noise
* speedsearch04: first study with MOT-like motion (paired with
  speedtrack02)
* speedsearch05 (NIA): aborted MOT-like search with limited exposure
  duration
* speedsearch06: MOT-like search with staircased exposure durations
