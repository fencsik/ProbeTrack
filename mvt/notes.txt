Potential follow-up studies:

Present target cues during movement: i.e., Ss identify the targets
while they're already moving, which eliminates need to switch from
immobile to mobile targets, but still have to track subset of
identical targets for 5 s.

step up speed in ShiftTrack3 to see if changes effect of -1 = 0 > 1.

Look at function of tracking with reappearance positions in the range
[-1,1]. But we need to be careful to achieve some power here.

Start putting an intervening task into the gap, or before/after the
tracking task. 

Orthogonally vary distance travelled and trajectory changes during
blank interval. 

Start playing with confusion just before disappearance: e.g., multiple
objects cross over, post-gap distractor is closer to pre-gap target
than the post-gap target.

Well, what the heck do we know now? Results of ShiftTrack3 are that -1
and 0 are approx. equivalent,
