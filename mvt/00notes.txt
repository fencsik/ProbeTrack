List of Experiments:

Note: Tracking code was moved to a CVS repository starting with
ShiftTrack3

ShiftTrack3: compare reappearance positions -1, 0, and 1.
ShiftTrack4: same as above, but with all objects freezing upon
	     reappearance to eliminate confound. Also adds ntargets
	     manipulation (ntargets = {2,5})
ShiftTrack5: ShiftTrack3 with asynchronous disappearance.
ShiftTrack6: ShiftTrack4 with a within-subjects design.
StopTrack1: Basic stoptrack, with moving and static conditions and
	    tracking load conditions of 1 and 4.
StopTrack2: StopTrack1 with tracking loads of 1-4.
StopTrack3: static and moving tracking, 2 and 4 targets, with random
	    trial length.
StopTrack4: StopTrack3 with extra practice block (and all new
	    subjects).
