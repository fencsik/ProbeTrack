Target Tracking During Interruption in the Multi-Element Visual
Tracking Task

Fencsik, Horowitz, Place, Klieger, and Wolfe

Observers can successfully track a subset of randomly moving identical
objects in a multi-element visual tracking (MVT) task, even if all of
the objects disappear for a 300-500 ms gap.  How observers reacquire
targets following such a gap reveals what kinds of information they
maintain for moving objects.  With identical objects, there are only
two types of information available: each object's present location and
its path of motion.  We report three sets of experiments intended to
reveal how observers use these two type of information in MVT.  In one
set, each object reappeared either at the same position it had
occupied prior to the gap (no-move; the position expected if observers
only remembered the targets' pre-gap locations), the position expected
if each had continued moving at a constant velocity during the gap
(move; the position expected if observers anticipated reappearance
position based on pre-gap trajectories), or at a point as far behind
the no-move position as the move position was ahead of it (rewind).
We found that tracking accuracy on move and rewind conditions were
equivalent, supporting the use of location information in target
reacquisition.  In the second set of experiments, we compared
performance on the same move condition with one in which none of the
objects moved before the gap; following the gap, each object
reappeared displaced by the same distance as in the move condition.
Tracking performance was better with pre-gap movement than without,
demonstrating that observers made use of motion information for some
objects.  In the final set of experiments, we compared a condition
where all objects disappeared simultaneously to a condition in which
objects disappeared one at a time.  Our results indicate that two
distinct mechanisms may be used in these two cases: one for general
task-postponement, and the other for maintaining object continuity
during occlusion.
