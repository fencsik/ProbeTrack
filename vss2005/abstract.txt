Target Tracking During Interruption in the Multi-Element Visual
Tracking Task

Fencsik, Horowitz, Place, Klieger, and Wolfe

Observers can successfully track a subset of randomly moving identical
objects in a multi-element visual tracking (MVT) task, even if all of
the objects disappear for a 300-500 ms offset. How observers reacquire
targets following such an offset reveals what kinds of information
they maintain for moving objects. With identical objects, there are
only two types of information available: each object's present
location and its path of motion. We report three sets of experiments
intended to reveal how observers use these two types of information in
MVT. In Experiment 1, objects disappeared and then reappeared at one
of three locations: at the point of disappearance ("stay" condition"),
at the position predicted by continued motion during the offset
("forward"), or at the position predicted if the object had reversed
direction during the offset ("reverse"). We found that tracking
accuracy in the stay condition was superior to both the forward and
reverse conditions, which were equivalent, supporting the use of
location information in target reacquisition. In Experiment 2, the
objects always reappeared in the forward position. In one condition,
the objects moved before they disappeared; in the other, they remained
stationary and simply reappeared in the forward position. Tracking
performance was better with pre-offset movement than without,
demonstrating that observers made use of motion information.
Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 1, but with a condition in which
objects disappeared one at a time. In this case, tracking accuracy in
the forward condition, while still worse than in the stay condition,
was now superior to that in reverse condition. These results may
reveal two distinct mechanisms used in MVT: one for general
task-postponement during simultaneous offset, and the other for
maintaining object continuity during single-object disappearance or
occlusion.
