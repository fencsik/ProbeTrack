Abstract for VSS 2005

Observers can successfully track a subset of randomly moving identical
objects in a multi-element visual tracking (MVT) task, even if all of
the objects disappear for a 300-500 ms gap.  By studying how observers
reacquire targets following such a gap, we might reveal what kinds of
information they maintain for moving objects.  With identical objects,
there are only two types of information available: each object's
present location and its path of motion.  We report two sets of
experiments intended to reveal how observers use this type of
information in MVT.  In one set, all objects reappeared either at the
same position they had occupied prior to the gap (the position
expected if observers only remembered the targets' pre-gap locations),
the position expected if each had continued moving at a constant
velocity during the gap (the position expected if observers
anticipated reappearance position based on pre-gap trajectories), or
