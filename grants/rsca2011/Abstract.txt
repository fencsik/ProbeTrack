Attention enables us to focus on some parts of our environment and ignore
others.  One critical aspect of attention is the ability to move it rapidly
from one object to another, or one task to another.  For example, driving
requires that you move your attention between the traffic in front of you,
the mirrors around you, and the dashboard.  I and my collaborators have
developed a technique for measuring the time taken to recover following
such movements of attention.  In the present proposal, I seek assigned time
in Winter 2012 to write a manuscript describing our work and submit it for
publication in a professional, peer-reviewed journal.  Finishing this paper
will allow me to complete the first phase of this project and begin work on
the next phase.  In the next phase, we plan to apply the technique to
real-world problems, such as the effects that distracting tasks like
cell-phone conversations can have on recovery time.
