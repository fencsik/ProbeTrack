In the present proposal, I seek assigned time in Winter 2012 to write a
manuscript describing my recent work on attention and submit it to a
peer-reviewed journal for publication.  Attention enables us to focus on
some parts of our environment and ignore others.  One critical aspect of
attention is the ability to move it rapidly from one object to another, or
one task to another.  For example, driving requires that you move your
attention between the traffic in front of you, the mirrors around you, and
the dashboard.  I and my collaborators have developed a technique for
measuring the time taken to recover following such movements of attention,
and have completed several experiments using the technique.  I have
presented this work at a conference, but I have not been able to prepare it
for publication yet.  Finishing this paper will allow me to complete the
first phase of this project and begin work on the next phase.  In the next
phase, we plan to apply the technique to real-world problems, such as the
effects that distracting tasks like cell-phone conversations can have on
recovery time.
