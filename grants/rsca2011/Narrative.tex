\MySection{A. Summary Description}

% My Background and Topic

My background is in cognitive psychology, in which we study the mind and
brain as a set of separate processes, each of which process information in
some way.  The focus of my research is on attention and short-term memory,
the processes that select relevant information and store it briefly while
it is relevant to the task at hand.

% The project

The current proposal seeks to advance my research on how attention switches
between different sources of information.  I and my colleagues have
developed a technique based on the multiple object tracking (MOT) task.  In
the MOT task, a set of identical objects move randomly around a computer
display, and people must keep track of a subset of those objects.

In our technique, the objects all disappear briefly, then reappear.
Previous research shows that this disappearance simulates what happens when
we briefly look away from a scene (e.g., when you glance at your dashboard
while driving).  By testing
