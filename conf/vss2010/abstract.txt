When people are engaged in dynamic tasks, such as monitoring traffic while
driving or supervising children on a playground, they are able to keep
track of multiple moving objects even through disruptions to the task
(e.g., looking away).  Previous research suggests the existence of a
mechanism that can store tracked objects offline during disruption so the
visual system can perform a secondary task, then later resume tracking
without complete loss.  We describe a set of studies investigating the
process of recovering targets following disruption to a tracking
task. Participants tracked a set of moving targets among identical moving
distractors.  During tracking, all objects disappeared simultaneously, then
reappeared after a brief delay.  At some delay following reappearance, one
object was probed, and participants identified the probed object as a
target or distractor.  We found that RT decreased over probe delays of 0-50
ms following reappearance, then remained constant.  We developed a model
based on the assumption that the visual system takes X ms to recover
following the gap.  The model fits the data best when X is around 45 ms,
regardless of the duration of the disappearance or the number of targets
tracked.  This suggests that recovery of tracked objects following a
disruption occurs rapidly and in parallel.
