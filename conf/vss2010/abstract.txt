While tracking tasks, such as monitoring traffic while driving or
supervising children on a playground, would seem to require continuous
visual attention, in fact we can track multiple moving objects even through
disruptions to the task (e.g., looking away).  How do we do this?  We have
previously suggested a mechanism that stores information about tracked
objects offline during disruption so the visual system can perform a
secondary task, then later resume tracking without complete loss (Horowitz
et al., 2006).  Here we studied the timecourse of target recovery following
a brief disruption.  Participants tracked a set of moving targets among
identical moving distractors.  During tracking, all objects disappeared
simultaneously, then reappeared after a brief gap (133-507 ms).  Objects
continued to move during the gap.  At a variable delay following
reappearance, one object was probed; participants identified the probed
object as target or distractor.  RT decreased over probe delays of 0-50 ms
following reappearance, then remained constant.

We developed a model based on the assumption that the visual system takes X
ms to recover the targets following the gap. The model fits the data best
when X is around 45 ms, regardless of the duration of the disappearance or
the number of targets tracked.

This suggests that recovery of tracked objects following disruption occurs
rapidly and in parallel.
