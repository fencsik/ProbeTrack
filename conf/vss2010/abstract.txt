When people are engaged in dynamic tasks, such as monitoring traffic while driving or monitoring children on a playground, they are able to keep track of multiple moving objects even through disruptions to the task.  Previous research suggests the existence of a mechanism that can store tracked objects offline during disruption so the visual system can perform a secondary task, then later resume tracking without complete loss.  We describe a set of studies investigating the process of recovering targets following disruption to a tracking task.  Participants tracked a set of moving targets among identical moving distractors.  During tracking, all objects disappeared simultaneously, then reappeared after a brief delay.  At some delay following reappearance, one object was probed, and participants identified the probed object as a target or distractor.  We found that RT decreased from 0 ms following reappearance until around 50 ms, from which point on it remained constant.  We developed a model
