Tracking tasks, such as monitoring traffic while driving or supervising
children on a playground, would seem to require continuous visual
attention.  In fact, we can track multiple moving objects even through
disruptions to the task, such as looking away.  How do we do this?  We have
previously suggested a mechanism that stores information about tracked
objects offline during disruption, so the visual system can perform a
secondary task, then later resume tracking without complete loss (Horowitz
et al., 2006).

Here we studied the timecourse of target recovery following a brief
disruption.  Participants tracked a set of moving targets among identical
moving distractors.  During tracking, all objects disappeared
simultaneously, then reappeared after a brief gap (133-507 ms).  Objects
continued to move during the gap.  At a variable delay following
reappearance, one object was probed.  Participants identified the probed
object as a target or distractor.  RT decreased over probe delays of
roughly 0-50 ms following reappearance, then remained constant.

We assumed that RT would decline linearly as a function of delay with a
slope of -1, and estimated recovery time as the delay at which RT reached
baseline.  Across XXX experiments, recovery time was around 45 ms.  This
value did not change as a function of gap duration or tracking load.  These
results suggest that recovery of tracked objects following disruption
occurs rapidly and in parallel.
