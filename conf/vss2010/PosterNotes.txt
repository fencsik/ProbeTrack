Outline:
 * Background
   - Tracking tasks seem to require continuous attention.
   - But Alvarez et al. (2005) showed that we can continue tracking even
     through brief disruptions.
   - Horowitz et al. (2006) proposed a postponement mechanism to store
     tracking information during brief disruptions.
 * Question: How long does it take to recover the targets after the
   disruption ends?
 * Method
 * Analysis
 * Experiment 1: Basic finding
 * Experiment 2: Confirmation with more Probe Delays
 * Experiment 3: Confirmation with 3 targets and shorter delays
 * Experiment 4: Confirmation with 2 targets
 * Experiment 5: Not just the short gap duration
 * Conclusions:
   - Post-gap recovery is rapid
   - Seems to take about 40 ms to recover all targets and resume tracking
 * Future Directions:
   - Is this recovery time affected by a secondary task?
   - Alvarez et al.'s (2005) results suggest not, but it hasn't been
     measured yet.
   - If so, what aspects of the secondary task might influence the recovery
     time?
