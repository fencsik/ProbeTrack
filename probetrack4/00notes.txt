Subjects jia, mz, and wms have 50 trials marked as block 1,
gapDuration 0, whereas the other subjects have 5 such trials.

These three subjects have no trials marked as block 2, gapDuration 0,
whereas the other subjects have 50 such trials.

These three subjects have five fewer trials total (270) than all the
other subjects (275). 

It seems that, for these three subjects, we are missing 5 block-1
trials for gapDuration 0.  This seems to be no big loss, give that
these trials were just for practice, anyway.

I went in and changed the original data files for these three subjects
so that their gapDuration 0 trials are marked as block 2, for
consistency.

This is necessary because I filter out data based on block number,
assuming that block 1 trials are practice and block 2 trials are
experimental.
