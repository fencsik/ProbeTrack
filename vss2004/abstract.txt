Tracking Multiple Moving Objects Before, During, and After Disappearance

Observers in multi-element tracking experiments can successfully
track a subset of randomly moving identical objects, even if all of
the objects disappear for 300-400 ms (e.g., Alvarez, Wolfe, Horowitz,
& Arsenio, 2001). Thus, the mechanisms used for tracking must be able
to reacquire the objects once they reappear. One possibility is that,
after the gap, objects are matched to the pre-gap objects based on
spatial location. Another possibility is that tracking is based on
movement trajectories, so post-gap locations can be predicted from
pre-gap motion. We report a series of experiments designed to
investigate the mechanisms used to reacquire moving objects after a
gap. In our studies, observers tracked 5 out of 10 dark gray disks
moving randomly on a light gray background for 5 sec. During the
tracking interval, all the objects disappeared for a 300 ms gap, then
reappeared at various distances from their pre-gap locations. Our
results indicate that both spatial-location and trajectory information
are used in reacquiring objects after a gap.
