The Use of Trajectory Information in Multiple Object Tracking

Observers are able to follow a subset of randomly moving identical
objects. They are even able to do this when the objects disappear for
up to a 400 ms interval (REF?). We investigate possible mechanisms
that could facilitate matching objects across a blank interval. One
possible mechanism is location-based matching, and another is
predictive tracking based on the pre-disappearance trajectories of
each object. In our studies, observers tracked 5 out of 10 dark gray
disks moving randomly on a light gray background for 5 sec. During the
tracking interval, all the objects disappeared for a 300 ms blank
interval, then reappeared at various distances from their
pre-disappearance locations. Through a series of such experiments, we
show that both spatial location and trajectory information are used
for re-acquiring
