The present paper focuses on how the visual system deals with the
temporary disappearance of moving objects. People can continue to
track objects that disappear briefly behind occluding surfaces. Scholl
and Pylyshyn (1999) demonstrated this using a multiple object tracking
(MOT) task, in which participants track a subset of identical,
independently moving objects. Accuracy on the task was unaffected on
trials when tracked objects moved behind occluding surfaces, as
compared to trials without occlusion. However, when objects
spontaneously disappeared and then reappeared without occlusion cues,
but for the same amount of time as on occlusion trials, accuracy was
substantially decreased compared to the other trials. It appears that
the visual system assumes that an occluded object still exists and
therefore continues to track it, while an object that spontaneously
disappears must no longer exist and ceases to track it (see also
Scholl & Feigenson, 2004).

On the face of it, this is an entirely reasonable assumption: in the
real world, when you are gazing at an object, the only way it can
disappear is through occlusion. Based on the findings of Scholl and
Pylyshyn (1999), it appears that the visual system continues to track
such objects. However, objects can also disappear when gaze is shifted
temporarily, in which case all tracked objects will disappear, then
reappear, simultaneously. Given that a shift in gaze may mean that a
new set of stimuli need to be tracked, there should be some
psychological mechanism that enables disengagement from the tracking
task, followed by re-engagement and reacquisition of tracked targets.

In previous work, we have demonstrated that observers can successfully
perform a MOT task when all the stimuli disappear simultaneously for a
brief (approximately 300 ms) gap.  Horowitz, Birnkrant, Wolfe, and
Fencsik (in press) showed that tracking through such a gap is more
difficult when the stimuli appear to move behind occluding surfaces
than when they disappear suddenly, without occlusion.  This result is
the opposite of Scholl and Pylyshyn's (1999) finding that occlusion
cues facilitate tracking when a single object disappears.  This
dissociation suggests that the mechanisms underlying tracking during
simultaneous disappearance are not the same as those that subserve
active tracking of visible objects.  In fact, Alvarez, Horowitz,
Arsenio, DiMase, and Wolfe (2005) showed that performance of a second
task during a gap in tracking had almost no effect on tracking
itself.

These results indicate that there must be some mechanism separate from
the tracking mechanism that enables temporary postponement of the
tracking task during a gap.  information relevant to tracking is
stored by this mechanism and is used to reacquire targets following
reappearance. In a recent paper (Fencsik, Klieger, & Horowitz,
submitted), we provided evidence that observers performing an MOT task
may remember both an object's location and direction of motion prior
to the gap; while they may use either type of information to reacquire
targets after the gap, they seem to have more location information
available and tend to favor using it for target reacquisition. In the
present work, we focus on the timecourse of target reacquisition:
Following the temporary disappearance of all tracked objects, how long
does the visual system take to resume tracking the targets.

To study the timecourse of target reacquisition, we present a series
of experiments using the MOT task with a gap in tracking.  Following
the gap at a variable delay, one stimulus was probed.  Observers
classified the probed stimulus as a tracked target or an untracked
distractor; a target was probed on half of the trials, and a
distractor was probed on the remaining trials.  We measured the speed
and accuracy of responses to the probe as a function of probe onset
latency in order to determine how long it took for observers to
reacquire the targets.

If, on a trial with a target probe, the probe onsets after target
reacquisition has been completed for the probed target, then an
accurate decision can be made immediately and reaction time (RT) will
not include any time to reacquire the target.  However, if the probe
onsets before the probed target had been reacquired, then response
will be slowed until reacquisition of that target has been completed.
In order to measure the minimum RT to respond to a probe, we included
a control condition in which there was no gap.

We used the results of our experiments to distinguish between two
broad classes of hypotheses about target reacquisition.  First, one
could propose that target reacquisition occurs in serial, such that
targets are reacquired one at a time with some additional amount of
time needed for each individual target.  Second, target reacquisition
could be a parallel process, in which all targets are reacquired
simultaneously, with no additional cost in time from each individual
target.  In general terms, serial hypotheses would predict longer
target reacquisition times---on the order of a hundred
milliseconds---than would a parallel process---on the order of tens of
milliseconds, or possibly instantaneous reacquisition.

General Methods


Experiment 1 (ProbeTrack1)

In Experiment 1, we introduce the basic methodology and observe that
target reacquisition occurs quite rapidly, in 80 ms or less. In this
experiment, the volunteers ranged in age from ??-?? (mean?; gender
distribution). Initially, observers performed 50 trials with no gap,
followed by 200 trials with a gap (see the General Methods for more
details).  During the trials with a gap, the probe onset either 0, 80,
320, or 1280 ms (0, 6, 24, or 96 frames) after the stimuli
reappeared. Probe onset delay was randomized within block.  This
design resulted in 50 trials per level of probe delay (25 target probe
and 25 distractor probe).

Figure 1A shows average RT for correct responses as a function of
probe delay separately for probe-target and probe-distractor
trials. The main effect of probe type was reliable, with shorter RTs
to target probes (MEAN) than distractor probes (MEAN); F-TEST. The
main effect of probe delay was also probably reliable, but I don't
know because I have no data; F-TEST. XXX Do planned pairwise
comparisons for each successive probe delay for each probe type
XXX. The dashed horizontal lines indicate baseline performance on each
probe type from the no-gap trials, and the error bars indicate 95%
confidence intervals for the repeated measures comparison of each
data-point from the no-gap RT (Masson & Loftus, 2003).  Clearly, only
the values at 0 ms are reliably different from baseline; at 0 ms, p <
.XXX, otherwise, p > .XXX.

Figure 1B plots sensitivity to the probe's identity as target or
distractor, measured using d' (MacMillan & Creelman, 2005), as a
function of probe delay. XXX Are there any reliable effects here? XXX
Again, the error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals based on the
comparisons between each point and baseline sensitivity. Performance
with a gap was reliably below performance without a gap at all probe
delays.

This shows us that response time hits baseline levels within 80 ms of
stimulus reappearance. However, accuracy remains low across probe
delays.  This is okay, because it merely indicates that they didn't
recover all targets, but it suggests that at least some of the RTs
come from guesses, which could be problemmatical.


Experiment 2 (ProbeTrack2)

In Experiment 2, we expanded the range of probe delays to investigate
the timecourse of target reacquisition more carefully. Observers
ranged in age from ??-?? (mean ?; N females, 8-N males).  Observers
performed 50 trials with no gap, followed by XXX 250 or 300 XXX trials
with a gap.  During trials with a gap, the probe onset either 0, 40,
80, 120, 160, or 1280 ms (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, or 96 frames) after the
stimuli reappeared. Probe onset delay was randomized within block.
This design resulted in 50 trials per level of probe delay (25 target
probe and 25 distractor probe).

Figure 2A shows average RT for correct responses as a function of
probe delay separately for probe-target and probe-distractor
trials. The main effect of probe type was reliable, with shorter RTs
to target probes (MEAN) than distractor probes (MEAN); F-TEST. The
main effect of probe delay was also reliable in all likelihood, but I
haven't got the analysis yet; F-TEST. XXX Do planned pairwise
comparisons XXX. Again, the horizontal lines indicate baseline
performance from the no-gap trials, and the error bars show the 95%
confidence intervals for the comparison between the RTs from the gap
trials and the average RT from the no-gap trials.  Only the values at
0 ms are reliable different from baseline; at 0 ms, p < .XXX,
otherwise, p > .XXX.

XXX What's the story in the accuracy data?  Probably the same as for
Experiment 1. XXX

These results confirm and extend the findings from Experiment
1. RT to the probe was lengthened only when the probe onset
concurrently with stimulus reappearance, and returned to baseline
levels immediately after reappearance. The present results suggest
that targets are reacquired within 40 ms of reappearance. This finding
is consistent with the hypothesis that targets are reacquired rapidly,
most likely in parallel.


Experiment 3 (ProbeTrack3)

In Experiment 3, we generalize our findings from the earlier
experiments to a wider range of gap durations.  In the first two
experiments, the stimuli disappeared for a gap of 133 ms on every
trial.  In Experiment 3, we added trial blocks with gap durations of
307 ms and 507 ms.

Beyond simply generalizing the results from the previous experiments,
Experiment 3 allows us to test an alternative hypothesis, that the
performance with a short gap does not require task postponement.  If
this were the case, then participants would not lose the targets
during the gap and would not have to reacquire them after it.
According to this hypothesis, then, the finding in previous
experiments that post-gap RTs equalled no-gap RTs at short probe
delays is uninteresting.  However, at longer gap durations, observers
do seem to postpone the tracking task, storing information about it in
a separate mechanism until the stimuli reappear (Alvarez, et al.,
2005).  Thus, the alternative hypothesis predicts that it should take
longer after the gap for RT to return to baseline levels on trials
with larger gap durations---that is, the RT by probe delay functions
observed in Experiments 1 and 2 should be shifted to the right at the
longer gap durations in Experiment 3.

However, if a 133 ms gap is long enough to require postponement of the
tracking task, then there should be no difference in RT across gap
durations.  This will confirm our previous findings, that target
reacquisition seems to completed very rapidly following the gap.

Speed-accuracy tradeoff: RT is same across gap durations, but accuracy
declines with gap duration.  Suggests that a speed-accuracy tradeoff
may be masking increasing RT.  This claim predicts that RT is speeded
because of fast-guesses, which in turn predicts not only that
incorrect responses should be faster than correct responses, but that
the difference between correct and incorrect RTs should increase with
gap duration.

The procedure was identical to
