Rapid recovery of moving targets following task disruption

David E. Fencsik, Skyler S. Place, and Todd S. Horowitz

Driving an automobile involves simultaneously performing a variety of
tasks: the driver must maintain control of the vehicle, react to
traffic signals, plan a route, and often carry out these tasks while
also listening to music or carrying on conversations with passengers.
However, all these tasks are secondary to the basic need to monitor
the environment, a continuously shifting collection of lanes,
sidewalks, traffic signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles.  In order
to successfully maneuver through traffic, we must have cognitive
mechanisms that can keep track of a set of moving objects, focusing on
those that are most important and ignoring the rest, and accomodate
brief disruptions from other tasks.  In the present paper, we focus
on the ability of the tracking mechanisms to recover from disruption.

[The previous paragraph could start out by talking about tracking as
fundamental to driving, then talk about the need to deal with
distraction.]

Tracking mechanisms have been studied in the laboratory through the
multiple object tracking (MOT) task (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988).  During
a trial in a typical MOT study, observers are asked to keep track of a
subset of stimuli ("targets") as they move independently around a
display.  After several seconds of tracking, all stimuli stop, and the
observer indicates whether or not a probed stimulus was a target; both
the accuracy and latency of each response may be measured as dependent
variables.  Observers can typically track around 4-5 targets out of
8-10 total objects (Pylyshyn & Storm, 1988).  This demonstrates that
there is a mechanism capable of tracking multiple moving objects
without maintaining gaze on them.

Observers can track successfully even if the tracked stimuli disappear
briefly (Alvarez et al., 2005; Fencsik et al., 2007; Horowitz et al.,
2006; Keane & Pylyshyn, 2006; Scholl & Pylyshyn, 1999).  In fact,
tracking performance is no worse when interrupted with a brief blank
interval of some duration than when interrupted by another visually
demanding task for an equivalent duration (Alvarez et al., 2005).
These results indicate that there must be some mechanism separate from
the tracking mechanism that enables temporary postponement of the
tracking task during disappearance or disruption.  Information
relevant to tracking is stored by this mechanism and is used to
reacquire targets following reappearance.

In the present work, we focus on the timecourse of target
reacquisition: Following the temporary disappearance of all tracked
objects, how long does the visual system take to resume tracking the
targets?

To study the timecourse of target reacquisition, we present a series
of experiments using the MOT task with a gap in tracking.  Following
the gap at a variable delay, one stimulus was probed.  Observers
classified the probed stimulus as a tracked target or an untracked
distractor; a target was probed on half of the trials, and a
distractor was probed on the remaining trials.  We measured the speed
and accuracy of responses to the probe as a function of probe onset
latency in order to determine how long it took for observers to
reacquire the targets.

If, on a trial, the probe onsets after target reacquisition has been
completed for the probed target, then an accurate decision can be made
immediately and reaction time (RT) will not include any time to
reacquire the target.  However, if the probe onsets before the probed
target had been reacquired, then response will be slowed until
reacquisition of that target has been completed.

We used the results of our experiments to distinguish between two
broad classes of hypotheses about target reacquisition.  First, one
could propose that target reacquisition occurs in serial, such that
targets are reacquired one at a time with some additional amount of
time needed for each individual target.  Second, target reacquisition
could be a parallel process, in which all targets are reacquired
simultaneously, with no additional cost in time from each individual
target.  In general terms, serial hypotheses would predict longer
target reacquisition times---on the order of a hundred
milliseconds---than would a parallel process---on the order of tens of
milliseconds, or possibly instantaneous reacquisition.

Paragraph on general method

Paragraph or less on model

In Experiment 1, we introduce the basic methodology and observe that
target reacquisition occurs quite rapidly.  Observers responded to
probes that onset 0, 80, 320, or 1280 ms (0, 6, 24, or 96 frames)
after the 130 ms (10 frame) gap.  Probe onset delay was randomized
within block.  The design resulted in 50 trials per level of probe
delay (25 target probe and 25 distractor probe).  Volunteers ranged in
age from 22-40 (M = 29.1; 6 females).

To analyze the results, we computed each observer's median RT from
correct responses, collapsing across probe types.  The open circles in
Figure 1 indicate average median RT as a function of probe delay; the
filled squares and dashed line indicate average d' (MacMillan &
Creelman, 2005).  We conducted separate repeated measures ANOVAs on
median RT and d' as a function of probe delay.  There was a reliable
effect of probe delay on median RT; F(4, 28) = 9.34, MSE = 1256, p <
.001.  The main effect of probe delay on d' was marginally reliable;
F(4, 28) = 2.27, MSE = 0.1914, p = .087.  The error bars indicated 95%
confidence intervals based on the within subject error (Masson &
Loftus, 2003).

To further characterize the results, we fit the reacquisition model to
each observer's median RT by probe delay function.  We used a gradient
descent algorithm to find the values for each parameter, t_r and t_b,
that best fit the observed median RTs.  The predicted median RTs based
on the average parameter values are plotted as the solid line in
Figure 1.  The averaged function predicts the observed data well, with
R^2 = .88.  The average estimated reacquisition time was 83 ms, with a
95% confidence interval (CI) spanning 38--128 ms.  While this is a
wide range, it constrains the postgap recovery time to less than 150
ms.

We conducted a second experiment in order to generate a more precise
estimate of reacquisition time.  Since it appears to fall
approximately in the range of 40--120 ms, we added probe delays to
cover that interval with greater resolution than in Experiment 1.
Probes appeared 0, 40, 80, 120, 160, or 1280 ms (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, or 96
frames) after gap offset.  The results of this experiment are plotted
in Figure 2, which is analogous to Figure 1.  There was a reliable
effect of probe delay on median RT; F(5, 35) = 2.99, MSE = 1423, p =
.024.  However, there was no reliable effect of probe delay on d';
F(5, 35) = .57, MSE = 0.25, p = .719.  The average estimated
reacquisition time, based on the best fit of the model to each
observer's results, was 44 ms, with a 95% CI spanning 18--69 ms.
Clearly, the observers had returned to tracking by around 40 ms
following gap offset.

One possible explanation of our results is that the gaps we used, 133
ms, were too brief to trigger task-postponement mechanisms.  To test
this possibility, we conducted a third experiment in which we varied
gap duration, including gaps of 133, 307, and 507 ms (10, 23, and 38
frames).  In previous experiments, we have shown that performance with
these longer gaps is equivalent to performance with a secondary task,
suggesting that such gaps do trigger task-postponement mechanisms.  If
a 133 ms gap does not involve task postponement, then we would expect
gap duration to effect the RT by probe delay function in Experiment 3,
and to lengthen the estimated reacquisition time.  However, there was
no effect of gap duration on median RT; F(2, 14) = 0.054, MSE = 36315,
p = .947.  Median RT did decline with probe delay; F(7, 49) = 6.71,
MSE = 1385, p < .001.  There was a marginally reliable interaction
between probe delay and gap duration, but this was caused by a single
unusual data point in the 320-ms probe delay and 307-ms gap duration
condition.  Aside from this one point, postgap performance was
identical across gap durations, suggesting that the same
task-postponement mechanisms that enable tracking through a 307- or
507-ms gap also function during a 133-ms gap.  To obtain a reliable
estimate of reacquisition time, we fit the model to the data from each
observer collapsed across gap duration.  The average estimated
reacquisition time was 44 ms, with a 95% CI spanning 23--65 ms.

The first three experiments suggest that targets are reacquired
rapidly following resumption of tracking.  In the final experiment, we
tested whether targets are recovered one-at-a-time or
all-at-once---that is, by a serial or parallel process.  We varied the
tracking load from one to four targets.  If target recovery is serial,
then it should take longer to recover all the targets as the tracking
load increases.  This will be apparent at the shortest probe delays as
a systematic increase in response time with tracking load, as it takes
longer, on average, to recover the targets.  However, if target
recovery occurs in parallel, there should be no systematic
relationship between tracking load and response time.  There was a
reliable effect of tracking load on median RT; F(3, 12) = 8.73, MSE =
5641, p < .001.  There was also a reliable effect of probe delay on
median RT; F(3, 21) = 7.77, MSE = 1233, p < .01.  However, the
interaction between tracking load and probe delay was not reliable;
F(9, 63) = 1.52, MSE = 932, p = .16.  The effect of tracking load on
RT appears to be driven by the one-target condition: when it is
eliminated, there is no longer a reliable effect of tracking load;
F(2, 14) = 1.09, MSE = 6127, p = .36.  Thus, there is no evidence that
target recovery is a serial process.  We again fit the model to the
data from each observer, looking only at the four-targets condition to
replicate previous analyses.  The average estimated reacquisition time
was again 44 ms, with a 95% CI spanning 14--74 ms.  It appears that all
targets are recovered simultaneously by about 44 ms.

(Note: There is some preliminary evidence of a tracking load effect on
RT.  As noted above, there is a reliable effect of tracking load on
RT.  However, this effect is reliable at every probe delay, suggesting
that tracking load is influencing another stage, not recovery
time---if the effect was primarily on recovery, then the tracking load
effect would only appear at shorter probe delays.  Additionally, all
effects disappear when the one-target condition is eliminated,
suggesting that this is an outlier-based effect.  An alternative
perspective comes from the RT x tracking load slopes.  Depending on
how you look at these, there could be some suggestive patterns.  These
suggestive patterns again disappear when the one-target condition is
dropped from the analysis.)

Discussion

The experiments presented above show that recovery of moving targets
after a brief disappearance occurs rapidly and in parallel.  Around 40
ms after the tracked stimuli reappeared, observers could distinguish
targets from distractors as quickly as if the stimuli had never
disappeared, suggesting that the tracking mechanisms were in the same
state they had been in prior to disappearance.

We propose that these findings generally indicate that any visual
information stored off-line during task postponement will be available
again rapidly after the task is resumed.  This differs from other
findings of task-switching costs that last for several hundred
milliseconds when people must switch from one task to another (e.g.,
Allport, Styles, & Hsieh, 1994; Rogers & Monsell, 1995; Rubinstein,
Meyer, & Evans, 2001; see Monsell, 2003, for a recent review).  To
perform those tasks successfully, all the processes relevant to
performing one task---including all the knowledge relevant to the
stimuli, stimulus-response mappings, and response preparation---must
be removed from memory and replaced with those of a different task.
The present results suggest that the cost of reloading the visual
information relevant to one task is quite small.  It may be other
aspects of a task, or the act of unloading another task from memory,
that imposes the higher switching costs observed in other studies.

Apply them to driving and other applied tasks



Cutting-room floor:

The present paper focuses on how the visual system deals with the
temporary disappearance of moving objects. People can continue to
track objects that disappear briefly behind occluding surfaces. Scholl
and Pylyshyn (1999) demonstrated this using a multiple object tracking
(MOT) task, in which participants track a subset of identical,
independently moving objects. Accuracy on the task was unaffected on
trials when tracked objects moved behind occluding surfaces, as
compared to trials without occlusion. However, when objects
spontaneously disappeared and then reappeared without occlusion cues,
but for the same amount of time as on occlusion trials, accuracy was
substantially decreased compared to the other trials. It appears that
the visual system assumes that an occluded object still exists and
therefore continues to track it, while an object that spontaneously
disappears must no longer exist and ceases to track it (see also
Scholl & Feigenson, 2004).

On the face of it, this is an entirely reasonable assumption: in the
real world, when you are gazing at an object, the only way it can
disappear is through occlusion. Based on the findings of Scholl and
Pylyshyn (1999), it appears that the visual system continues to track
such objects. However, objects can also disappear when gaze is shifted
temporarily, in which case all tracked objects will disappear, then
reappear, simultaneously. Given that a shift in gaze may mean that a
new set of stimuli need to be tracked, there should be some
psychological mechanism that enables disengagement from the tracking
task, followed by re-engagement and reacquisition of tracked targets.

In previous work, we have demonstrated that observers can successfully
perform a MOT task when all the stimuli disappear simultaneously for a
brief (approximately 300 ms) gap.  Horowitz, Birnkrant, Wolfe, and
Fencsik (in press) showed that tracking through such a gap is more
difficult when the stimuli appear to move behind occluding surfaces
than when they disappear suddenly, without occlusion.  This result is
the opposite of Scholl and Pylyshyn's (1999) finding that occlusion
cues facilitate tracking when a single object disappears.  This
dissociation suggests that the mechanisms underlying tracking during
simultaneous disappearance are not the same as those that subserve
active tracking of visible objects.  In fact, Alvarez, Horowitz,
Arsenio, DiMase, and Wolfe (2005) showed that performance of a second
task during a gap in tracking had almost no effect on tracking
itself.

These results indicate that there must be some mechanism separate from
the tracking mechanism that enables temporary postponement of the
tracking task during a gap.  Information relevant to tracking is
stored by this mechanism and is used to reacquire targets following
reappearance. In a recent paper (Fencsik, Klieger, & Horowitz,
submitted), we provided evidence that observers performing an MOT task
may remember both an object's location and direction of motion prior
to the gap; while they may use either type of information to reacquire
targets after the gap, they seem to have more location information
available and tend to favor using it for target reacquisition. In the
present work, we focus on the timecourse of target reacquisition:
Following the temporary disappearance of all tracked objects, how long
does the visual system take to resume tracking the targets.
