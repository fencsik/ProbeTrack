The present paper focuses on how the visual system deals with the
temporary disappearance of moving objects. People can continue to
track objects that disappear briefly behind occluding surfaces. Scholl
and Pylyshyn (1999) demonstrated this using a multiple object tracking
(MOT) task, in which participants track a subset of identical,
independently moving objects. Accuracy on the task was unaffected on
trials when tracked objects moved behind occluding surfaces, as
compared to trials without occlusion. However, when objects
spontaneously disappeared and then reappeared without occlusion cues,
but for the same amount of time as on occlusion trials, accuracy was
substantially decreased compared to the other trials. It appears that
the visual system assumes that an occluded object still exists and
therefore continues to track it, while an object that spontaneously
disappears must no longer exist and ceases to track it (see also
Scholl & Feigenson, 2004).

On the face of it, this is an entirely reasonable assumption: in the
real world, when you are gazing at an object, the only way it can
disappear is through occlusion. Based on the findings of Scholl and
Pylyshyn (1999), it appears that the visual system continues to track
such objects. However, objects can also disappear when gaze is shifted
temporarily, in which case all tracked objects will disappear, then
reappear, simultaneously. Given that a shift in gaze may mean that a
new set of stimuli need to be tracked, there should be some
psychological mechanism that enables disengagement from the tracking
task, followed by re-engagement and reacquisition of tracked targets.

In previous work, we have demonstrated that observers can successfully
perform a MOT task when all the stimuli disappear simultaneously for a
brief (approximately 300 ms) gap.  Horowitz, Birnkrant, Wolfe, and
Fencsik (in press) showed that tracking through such a gap is more
difficult when the stimuli appear to move behind occluding surfaces
than when they disappear suddenly, without occlusion.  This result is
the opposite of Scholl and Pylyshyn's (1999) finding that occlusion
cues facilitate tracking when a single object disappears.  This
dissociation suggests that the mechanisms underlying tracking during
simultaneous disappearance are not the same as those that subserve
active tracking of visible objects.  In fact, Alvarez, Horowitz,
Arsenio, DiMase, and Wolfe (2005) showed that performance of a second
task during a gap in tracking had almost no effect on tracking
itself.

These results indicate that there must be some mechanism separate from
the tracking mechanism that enables temporary postponement of the
tracking task during a gap.  information relevant to tracking is
stored by this mechanism and is used to reacquire targets following
reappearance. In a recent paper (Fencsik, Klieger, & Horowitz,
submitted), we provided evidence that observers performing an MOT task
may remember both an object's location and direction of motion prior
to the gap; while they may use either type of information to reacquire
targets after the gap, they seem to have more location information
available and tend to favor using it for target reacquisition. In the
present work, we focus on the timecourse of target reacquisition:
Following the temporary disappearance of all tracked objects, how long
does the visual system take to resume tracking the targets.

To study the timecourse of target reacquisition, we present a series
of experiments using the MOT task with a gap in tracking.  Following
the gap at a variable delay, one stimulus was probed.  Observers
classified the probed stimulus as a tracked target or an untracked
distractor; a target was probed on half of the trials, and a
distractor was probed on the remaining trials.  We measured the speed
and accuracy of responses to the probe as a function of probe onset
latency in order to determine how long it took for observers to
reacquire the targets.

If, on a trial with a target probe, the probe onsets after target
reacquisition has been completed for the probed target, then an
accurate decision can be made immediately and reaction time (RT) will
not include any time to reacquire the target.  However, if the probe
onsets before the probed target had been reacquired, then response
will be slowed until reacquisition of that target has been completed.
In order to measure the minimum RT to respond to a probe, we included
a control condition in which there was no gap.

We used the results of our experiments to distinguish between two
broad classes of hypotheses about target reacquisition.  First, one
could propose that target reacquisition occurs in serial, such that
targets are reacquired one at a time with some additional amount of
time needed for each individual target.  Second, target reacquisition
could be a parallel process, in which all targets are reacquired
simultaneously, with no additional cost in time from each individual
target.  In general terms, serial hypotheses would predict longer
target reacquisition times---on the order of a hundred
milliseconds---than would a parallel process---on the order of tens of
milliseconds, or possibly instantaneous reacquisition.
