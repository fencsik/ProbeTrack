Regarding ProbeTrack

A couple ideas for fixing analysis problems:

1. try fitting weibull to just target-probe trials (instead of data
   collapsed across probe-type)

   2007-03-07: tried this and didn't get much difference

2. try fitting weibull to averaged data, then comparing each subject
   to the estimated baseline

   2007-03-12: this won't work, dummy: while the average fit is quite
   clean, each individual subject is quite far from the average.

More ideas on ProbeTrack:

Fit a model that actually implements our theory about what is
occurring: that is, one which assumes that there is a delay of X ms
before tracking resumes.  Thus, RT reflects a baseline response time
plus the time required to reacquire the targets after the stimuli
reappear.  This leads to a formula like

RT = t + max(r - soa, 0)

where RT is the observed reaction time, t is the baseline response
time, r is the reacquisition time, and soa is the SOA.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Even better is a version of the above with distribution assumptions,
such that t (base RT) follows a gamma distributions with parameters
alpha and beta and r (reacquisition time) follows an exponential
distribution with parameter tau (or lambda).

Revisiting Probetrack.

I am revisiting the paper, and am surprised by how complete it is.  It
is a pretty compressed draft, and I think the big decision must be
between trying to continue compressing it (which would require some
extensive thinking/work on the figures, since there's a lot of
graphical info) or to expand it into a JEP/P&P style paper.

The paper seems mostly done.  Exp 4 needs to be revised for
Probetrack6b (instead of Probetrack4/3B and Probetrack5/3C), and the
discussion needs to be fleshed out.

Steps:
1. Complete/clean-up Probetrack6b analyses.
2. Re-write Exp 4 section.
3. Complete the discussion.
4. Add a paragraph describing the method in general terms.
5. Convert to MSWord and send to TSH.

Probetrack:

All of the previous steps have been completed.  The paper's discussion
needs to be expanded, and the mention of task-switching revised to
reflect the observations of ~50-ms switch costs, which are remarkably
close to the values we observed.

Also, I just had the idea of an obvious control experiment: What if we
used Scholl & Pylyshyn's (1999) occlusion-based disappearance, and
varied probe delay following disocclusion?  Because occlusion should
not trigger task-postponement mechanisms, one would expect to observe
no post-reappearance slowing at small probe delays.

April 28, 2010:

Need a study in which gap and no-gap trials are randomly intermixed in a
block so we can get a clean estimate of baseline RT.  This would
(hopefully) demonstrate that we're measuring what we claim to be measuring.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

September 27, 2010:

The above suggestion was repeated by Karla Evans at VSS shortly thereafter.
Brian Keane suggested using a large luminance change instead of a gap to
demonstrate that the recovery time is not caused by surprise.  Another
individual suggested using move and no-move trials (a la ShiftTrack) to
separate recovery of the targets from recovery of the task---presumably,
no-move trials involve less target recovery, but no less task recovery.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

October 13, 2010:

I have started running dual-task ProbeTrack experiments.  So far, we have
run simple versions in which people perform the standard ProbeTrack task,
but have to perform a word-generation task at the same time (a la Strayer &
Johnston, 2001).  There is a hint of slowing in some subjects when compared
to earlier single-task studies, but nothing significant.

What's needed is a proper experiment with baseline conditions so we can do
a within-subjects comparison.  The current version of the DT-ProbeTrack
code (as of Mon Oct 11 10:38:00 2010) collects 20 trials at each
combination of probe delay and target type and takes 30-40 minutes to run.
The next step should be one with three conditions---tracking-only, tracking
plus shadowing, and tracking plus word generation---properly
counterbalanced.  All this really requires is a new runsheet, although I
will also add a block label feature to the dual-task ProbeTrack code.

August 24, 2012:

Considering how to enhance the theoretical contribution of the ProbeTrack
paper.  Brockmole's feedback on the original paper submitted to JEP:HPP
suggests that there's not enough there.  The three options are as follows:

1. expand discussion of the theory we were testing: namely is there an
   offline task-postponement mechanism and can we observe one part
   (post-postponement recovery time)
2. bring in other theories about MOT: consider the implications of our work
   on index- vs. attention-based tracking mechanisms
3. relate our work to the task-switching literature: we have a hypothesized
   switching process without actually switching between two distinct tasks

Todd brought up a fourth possibility about comparing Keane's idea of
tracking through a gap with our idea of a postponement mechanism, but it's
hard to see how we're testing anything.

Our final idea was to use #3 above, but blend it with the MOT postponement
mechanism starting with the abstract and intro.  Start with application in
1st paragraph, then continue on with MOT and postponement, then connect it
with task switching and the notion that we have switching with just one
task.  That is, we have switching without conflict or surprise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

August 27, 2012:

Here's a sketch of the basic premise of the next version of the ProbeTrack
paper: Gap in tracking may be handled by task postponement mechanism.  This
may be like a task switch in that the tracking task gets put aside for a
brief period of time, then reloaded.  Basically, task-relevant information
(e.g., target locations, task rules) is removed from WM when the stimuli
disappear, then reloaded once they reappear.

If it's like a task switch, then we should see slower responses following
the gap that should be the same order of magnitude as a switch cost.  If
it's merely tracking through a gap, then there shouldn't be any recovery
time, because the task is ongoing.
