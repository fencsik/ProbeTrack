Regarding ProbeTrack

A couple ideas for fixing analysis problems:

1. try fitting weibull to just target-probe trials (instead of data
   collapsed across probe-type)

   2007-03-07: tried this and didn't get much difference

2. try fitting weibull to averaged data, then comparing each subject
   to the estimated baseline

   2007-03-12: this won't work, dummy: while the average fit is quite
   clean, each individual subject is quite far from the average.

More ideas on ProbeTrack:

Fit a model that actually implements our theory about what is
occurring: that is, one which assumes that there is a delay of X ms
before tracking resumes.  Thus, RT reflects a baseline response time
plus the time required to reacquire the targets after the stimuli
reappear.  This leads to a formula like

RT = t + max(r - soa, 0)

where RT is the observed reaction time, t is the baseline response
time, r is the reacquisition time, and soa is the SOA.

Even better is a version of the above with distribution assumptions,
such that t (base RT) follows a gamma distributions with parameters
alpha and beta and r (reacquisition time) follows an exponential
distribution with parameter tau (or lambda).

Revisiting Probetrack.

I am revisiting the paper, and am surprised by how complete it is.  It
is a pretty compressed draft, and I think the big decision must be
between trying to continue compressing it (which would require some
extensive thinking/work on the figures, since there's a lot of
graphical info) or to expand it into a JEP/P&P style paper.

The paper seems mostly done.  Exp 4 needs to be revised for
Probetrack6b (instead of Probetrack4/3B and Probetrack5/3C), and the
discussion needs to be fleshed out.

Steps:
1. Complete/clean-up Probetrack6b analyses.
2. Re-write Exp 4 section.
3. Complete the discussion.
4. Add a paragraph describing the method in general terms.
5. Convert to MSWord and send to TSH.

Probetrack:

All of the previous steps have been completed.  The paper's discussion
needs to be expanded, and the mention of task-switching revised to
reflect the observations of ~50-ms switch costs, which are remarkably
close to the values we observed.

Also, I just had the idea of an obvious control experiment: What if we
used Scholl & Pylyshyn's (1999) occlusion-based disappearance, and
varied probe delay following disocclusion?  Because occlusion should
not trigger task-postponement mechanisms, one would expect to observe
no post-reappearance slowing at small probe delays.

April 28, 2010:

Need a study in which gap and no-gap trials are randomly intermixed in a
block so we can get a clean estimate of baseline RT.  This would
(hopefully) demonstrate that we're measuring what we claim to be measuring.
