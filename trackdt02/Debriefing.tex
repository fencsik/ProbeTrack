      Tracking Experiment Debriefing
    \end{center}

    Thank you for volunteering to participate in this experiment.  The
    purpose of the experiment is to investigate how we perform demanding
    tasks while we are distracted by other tasks.  We know that
    distractions like cell phone conversations can make it harder to
    concentrate on demanding tasks like driving, but we don't yet know
    exactly how one task affects the other.  With this experiment, we are
    testing a theory that the conversation makes it harder to track moving
    objects, which is critical to driving through traffic.

    The results may be incorporated into a conference presentation or a
    published research article.  If you have any questions or concerns
    about this study, please contact Prof.\ David Fencsik by phone at
    510-885-2384 or by email at david.fencsik@csueastbay.edu.

    Thank you again.
