* data01: aggregate accuracy and RT statistics by subject, gap
  duration, probe type, number of targets, and probe delay

* an0101: anova on RT as a function of probe delay and probe type
* an0102: anova on accuracy as a function of probe delay and probe type
* an0103: t-tests comparing RT on gap trials at each probe delay to RT
  on no-gap trials
* an0104: t-tests comparing accuracy on gap trials at each probe delay
  to accuracy on no-gap trials
